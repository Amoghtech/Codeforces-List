The rules of the game are as follows: those who play for the first time, that is Vasya is the sleuth, he should investigate a &quot;crime&quot; and find out what is happening. He can ask any questions whatsoever that can be answered with &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. All the rest agree beforehand to answer the questions like that: if the question&#x2019;s last letter is a vowel, they answer &quot;Yes&quot; and if the last letter is a consonant, they answer &quot;No&quot;. Of course, the sleuth knows nothing about it and his task is to understand that.</p><p>Unfortunately, Vasya is not very smart.
